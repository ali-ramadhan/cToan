        Make sure everything works with boost::scoped_ptr!
        <comment>
            Well, it was only the Surface class but I'll keep it in mind!

        Should I do some enum switching and abstraction on EventHandler for the events?
        <comment>
            Done. Shoved all enums into a header that sits in the SDLWrap namespace.

        Is using private members + get functions retarded? Think on this one.
        <comment>
            Sticking with private/protected members. Seems I didn't friend or anything :D

        Design classes with dynamically allocated objects in mind? Example: Color arg in FontSurface constructor.

            Example was the only one xD

        Cut back on the SDLEngine class, its a bit bloated with stuff you dont use.
        <comment>
            Much better now :)

            Bare minimum now, I'll add to it later if I need to.

        Think of switching to accepting references to objects so that scoped/shared_ptr can work without *_ptr.get().
        <comment>
            Was only the Surface class, but done!

        Internally, the FontSurface class requires SDL_Color structs but you need pointers to Color objects. Find a midway solution.
        <comment>
            Very dirty solution but it'll do for now =/

        Rewrite the ErrorHandler class to a more abstract/generic Logger class.

        Redesign the LogType enum, what would something like SDL_BlitSurface() return -2 mean?

        Switch from doing assignment in constructor function to using assignment lists in all classes.

    <note priority="medium" time="1282692209" done="1282931305">
        Decide how to implement verbosity levels for Logger. Should I let the Log() function handle it or do it before actualling calling Log()?

        Isn't there a better way to construct objects other than using new and then resetting the scoped/shared pointer?
    </note>
    <note priority="veryhigh" time="1282955182">
        Add some sort of way to change the color of a FontSurface for the SettingsState class.

        How can I share fonts and other resources among different states? Singleton managers or maybe I should check up on the factory pattern...

    <note priority="medium" time="1282692149">
        Add more logging to all the classes, you've only done the SDLEngine class till now.

    <note priority="medium" time="1282746302">
        How about a GameState class that all game states derive from as classes and overload operator()?

        Add timestamps to the Logger class.

        Add a RenderedState enum to the FontSurface class so it knows how to re-render after a color change or something.

        Add SDL_image support to the Surface class.

            Maybe later, near the production stage?

        Handle the case of calling Shutdown() in the Font class while still having Fonts up. Maybe a non fatal error.
